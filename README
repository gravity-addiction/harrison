Manifesting Calendar for big ways currently.. it started out for a single
otter sized dropzone manifest. Migrated to Big Way manifesting.

you're here cause you've already forever borrowed this software, or at 
least thinking about it. couple pro-tips for you.

take the entire app directory, you'll need absolutely everything in it.

it's mostly javascript, it will run standalone, or if it's on a webserver 
post back to the .php or .aspx files for processing the data directory
files.

Enjoy.
